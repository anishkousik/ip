| Level-3 | Github Copilot | Add the ability to mark tasks as done and unmark them, as well as format the text in the AI.md file after writing down my description of my usage | **Feature:** Add mark/unmark commands for task completion status<br><br>**Commands:**<br>- `mark i` - Mark task i as done<br>- `unmark i` - Mark task i as not done<br><br>**Requirements:**<br>- Store task completion status in a boolean array<br>- Display `[X]` for completed tasks and `[ ]` for incomplete tasks in list output<br><br>**Expected Output Format:**<br><br>`list` output:<br>```<br>Here are the tasks in your list:<br>1.[X] read book<br>2.[ ] return book<br>3.[ ] buy bread<br>```<br><br>`mark 2` output:<br>```<br>Nice! I've marked this task as done:<br>  [X] return book<br>```<br><br>`unmark 2` output:<br>```<br>OK, I've marked this task as not done yet:<br>  [ ] return book<br>```<br><br>**Second Request:** Refactor to use a Task class instead of simple arrays<br><br>Store tasks in an array of Task objects with the following structure:<br><br>```java<br>public class Task {<br>    private String description;<br>    private boolean isDone;<br><br>    public Task(String description) {<br>        this.description = description;<br>        this.isDone = false;<br>    }<br><br>    public String getStatus() {<br>        return (isDone ? "X" : " "); // mark done task with X<br>    }<br>}<br>```<br><br>Maintain all existing functionality (mark, unmark, list, exit commands) with Task object array storage. Task index is determined by the array index. | Very easy to communicate requirements to the agent once I had a clear understanding of them. Copilot implemented the task exactly as specified on the first try. This saved significant time compared to manual implementation. The key to success was clearly defining the exact data structures, command formats, and output formatting needed. However, I have also noticed that it does "hardcode" some parts of the code such as the output format in the return message of the chatbot. Instead of writing one single System.out string text with appropriate formatting, it split it up into multiple calls which is interesting.|
